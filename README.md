# Webkit 

This package is deprecated, please check this link for the [most recent version](https://sourceforge.net/projects/phpbrowserbox/).

## What am I looking at?

You are looking at the main binary of phpbrowserbox i.e phpbrowserbox.exe that powers [phpbrowserbox](http://www.africoders.com/forum/phpbrowserbox). You can download the [full app here](https://sourceforge.net/p/phpbrowserbox/).

## Features
 * It grabs the port number to use for the localpath of the browser from support/port.ini
 * It starts mysql binaries to allow mysql support (by default, but this feature might be removed with no advertse effect)
 * It initiates the internal php server
 * It finally launches the webkit browser component found in support/webkit/webkit.exe 
 
If you are interested in modifying the webkit component, you should be looking at https://github.com/dhtml/webkit


## Installation and Usage
One of the main goals of phpbrowserbox is that the components should be flexible and easily replaceable.

This major aspect of the phpbrowserbox was written in dev c++ 5.11. If you are able to improve this aspect of the app, please share with the community

[Download the archive](https://github.com/dhtml/phpbrowserbox/archive/master.zip) and simply modify it, then repackage it as phpbrowserbox.exe.

And that should be all.
